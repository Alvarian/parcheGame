##  What is parcheesi ? <h4>

## Parcheesi is a game that I used to play  when I was a child. It's an amazing family game, that everybody can have fun. Here are the rules.
* You need 2-4 players.
* Each player would have four pieces.
* Each player would be assigned a starting position on the board.
* Everybody would end at the same place(Center).
* Each player would have a chance to roll the dices, and the points they get are the positions they are moving on the board, but if they get the same number in the dice , they get another change.
* If they endup in a "jail" position, they lose the next turn.
* The player that gets the four pieces to the center place wins.
