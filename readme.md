CSS       (Styling and animation) 
JavaScript(Main functionality(complemented with JQ)  
JQuery    (Create the board and DOM manipulation)

### Notes on Game Structure

> Code samples, description of challenges you overcame, etc.


###Challenges
My biggest challenge  was the images. I had a hard time and wasted a lot of time finding images. Those that i found were not labeled for reuse, so It was really hard. I wasted hours and  hours and hours on it. I have to find better resources for that.
Another thing is setting priorities, most the of the time I was spending to much time in thing that werent as importanta as others.

## The Making of Aur-cheesi
Making this game was amazing , the ideas came one after another, and at some point I had so many thing in my head that I was overwhelmed. But I will have the time to put those ideas in the game later.


## Opportunities for Future Growth
While I Was working on my project I had so many ideas, that couldn't focus on one thing at a time. So I decided to make a list of the things that I would do in the refactoring phase to make my game better.
Here they are:
* Make the game 3d
* Use better images and sounds.
* Be played from remote computers.
* Add more characters and features
